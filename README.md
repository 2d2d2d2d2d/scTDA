# scTDA
scTDA is an object oriented python library for topological data analysis of high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq
data. It includes tools for the preprocessing, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data based on topological representations.

To install scTDA run:

`pip install scTDA`

Alternatively, you can download the source code and run:

`python setup.py install`

For optimal visualization results it is strongly recommended to have Graphviz tools and PyGraphviz installed.

scTDA can be imported using the command:

`import scTDA`

A tutorial illustrating the basic scTDA workflow can be found in `doc/scTDA Tutorial.html`. The source notebook and data files for the 
tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lqlklu3j026onaa/scTDA%20Tutorial.tar.gz?dl=0).
